4. semester:
	3 processes;
		1: reptile
			checks power situation. 
				new information and updating the position on a map.
				will ping for power % once a minute. 
		2: sub
			possible routes
			order of businesses through the graph
			if anything is in the way
				new routes around opposition
			route decision based on graph and amount of power. 
		3: conscious
			physical controls, including camera and movement. 
				ROS has asynchronous 
				uses a subscription and message system
			sends position to sub to make decision
				camera
				position where it is.
				power usage.
				distance to target.
			
Is 3 parts really necessary?
	can likely do first with a thread
	second can be a program itself for possible routes, making a decision
	third is likely a program itself as well
